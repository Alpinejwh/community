<h1>Swift For Arduino</h1>
<p>FAQ</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Q: What is it?</em>
        <p>
        A: This is the world's first compiler for the Swift language onto the Arduino UNO. The Arduino is a popular IoT platform but due to it's compressed characteristics, many high level languages cannot function simply. The compiler uses LLVM magic to build a .hex suitable for uploading onto an Arduino UNO.

    <li><em>Q: What is the Lite version in the App Store for? And what are the differences?</em>
        <p>
        A: The Lite version on the App Store has the LLVM back end, GCC/binutils and avrdude removed and uses a build
        system not based on gmake.  All of this is due to very strict code signing and sandbox restrictions on the app
        store. The app will still allow you to verify that S4A programs will compile, check syntax, including any calls
        to AVR library functions as the module definition is still present and give you a good
        understanding of what the full tool can do. It should be a good place to learn how to use the IDE and give you
        a good grounding in programming Swift on Arduino. However it will not allow you to install the programs on an
        Arduino UNO or compatible. For that you will need the full product. Because of the functional limits, the Lite
        version is being deployed for free on the App Store for now.</p>
    </li>

    <li><em>Q: What is the file format?</em>
        <p>
        A: The editor is mostly a simple text editor for a swift file.  When you save a new document using the editor or open an existing document, a .swift4a file is used. The actual document is a bundle, a folder, containing the core .swift files and various related files.  Each tab will be saved in its own .swift file and one automatically maintained file called strings.def for string constants interned in progmem.  Then after a successful build you will see a .ll file, a .elf.s file and a .hex file, etc. in the bundle.  The .hex is the finished program that is uploaded to the board using avrdude.  The .ll and .elf.s are intermediate files that can be used for debugging issues or for sending to support for us to debug for you.  They're the LLVM IR and full asm of the finished ELF.  You can safely ignore the internals of the bundle and just treat it like any other document, Swift for Arduino should handle the rest for you.  If you have issues with your program, you can zip and send the full bundle to us, including your source code and these intermediates, together with an explanation of symptoms and we'll have a look: <a href="mailto:swiftforarduino@gmail.com">swiftforarduino@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <li><em>Q: Which boards are supported?</em>
        <p>
        A: Arduino UNO and probably most clones (untested).  The build system builds a .hex file compatile with the AVR Atmega328p microcontroller. If you plug an Arduino UNO into a USB port on your mac, the IDE should recognise the board and allow you to upload.  The IDE automatically figures out what serial device the Arduino presents and configures avrdude to upload using that interface.  It will also recognize the ICSP made by Arduino and automatically upload using that if present.  Most other ICSPs are not yet recognized.</p>

    <li><em>Q: Can I get this working with the ESP8266 or ESP32?</em>
        <p>
        A: LLVM upstream does not support this architecture so Swift for Arduino cannot target those processors.
        </p>
    </li>
    
    <li><em>Q: Can I get this working with Arduino board XX?</em>
        <p>
        A: I've had a few questions like this, which is very nice to hear as it shows people are interested! Out of the box Arduino UNO and compatibles will work, e.g. OrangePip, Seeeduino, RedBoard/FTDI based board, etc. You can try plugging them in and seeing if they're detected.</p>
        <p>As usual with a hobby project like this, I'm doing it in my spare time with my own kit so it's limited what I can write support for. If you know what you're doing and you have an Atmega328p processor based board, you can try exporting the compiled .hex using the File menu and uploading manually. Or you can use the Manual Board to attempt upload if you think it should work. I've successfully used a hex file saved like this to upload to a bare atmega328p on a breadboard, programmed via GPIO pins off a raspberry pi 2.  See http://petosoft.wordpress.com for details!
        </p>
        <p>
        For other Arduino/AVR based chips (e.g. at tiny chips), it will take more work to get the build system to output a suitable .hex.  But I'm happy to do it if enough people ask for it so far no one has shown interest in any other AVR based chip.

    <li><em>Q: Does this rely on the "standard" Arduino IDE (the one from their website)?</em>
        <p>
        A: No. This is a completely new project.  It contains an open source build of AVR GCC/binutils/libc that are used as the basis for many products such as WinAVR. Also it relies on open source Swift 3.1.1 which is included in the app. And lastly on a custom built variant of llvm, also packaged in the app.  The llvm, gcc, binutils executables and binaries and everything are included in the .app package.
        </p> 
        <p>
            One final point, as it has been asked before, the Arduino libraries are not used. The product uses it's own libraries for hardware support. And we have a growing library of open source samples and libraries written in Swift for Arduino itself. Libraries exist at the time of writing for sensor support, neopixels, servo and stepper motor support.
        </p>
    </li>
    
    <li><em>Q: Is this compatible with the Arduino IDE or libraries or the "Wiring" libraries</em>
        <p>
        A: This is two questions really. Firstly the Arduino IDE. Don't run this at the same time as the Swift for Arduino IDE or they will fight over the serial port!
        </p>
        <p>
        Secondly, for the Arduino/Wiring libraries, there deliberately is no compatibility layer. You cannot use them. I want to build a new community. I want the bulk of the library support code to be brand new, open source, Swift.

    <li><em>Q: I'm getting an error like avrdude: ERROR: address 0x8010 out of range at line 2049 of main.hex</em>
        <p>
        A: This is when the file produced is huge. We have seen it when swift/SIL optimisations are on but LLVM optimisations are off.
        Try turning on LLVM optimisations (MC optimisations). If it keeps happening, contact support on support@petosoft.com.
        </p>
    </li>
    
    <li><em>Q: Print isn't sending serial messages</em>
        <p>
        A: Make sure at the beginning of your main file you are calling SetupSerial somewhere and check you have the serial debug panel open.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><em>Q: I am seeing lots of build errors like "undefined reference to _swift_getExistentialTypeMetadata" or "undefined reference to _TMVs6UInt16"</em>
        <p>
        A: Make sure all your print() statements have named parameters like print(unsignedInt: ) or print(message: ), these errors are often the result of using
        a print() statement without a named parameter like print(aVar), where it incorrectly falls back to using the standard library.

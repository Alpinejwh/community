Installation
***
The IDE can be run directly from the dmg but it is better to copy the files down to disk.
We recommend that you make a folder on disk called "Swift For Arduino" or something similar and copy the entire contents of this dmg folder into there.  It will make things easier later.


Getting Started
***
To get started, try some of the examples in learning examples.

The FAQ gives answers to some frequently asked questions.

For a full view of the available API, look in the AVRPlayground

Some of the community site is also copied here. For up to date code, go to https://github.com/swiftforarduino/community

Note: if you have trouble recognising the board when it is plugged in (it does not show up in the drop down of available devices), you can try installing the drivers for the Silicon Labs USB->UART bridge. Open the folder "Lotus Seeeduino Support", then the disk image SiLabsUSBDriverDisk and then run the installer app and restart your Mac. This should resolve many issues.
